# What to Expect and How to Prepare

The job interview process can be daunting, with multiple rounds that test different skills. Understanding what to expect in each round and preparing accordingly is key to presenting your best self and landing the job. In this blog post, I'll walk you through what an interview process typically looks like and share tips for acing each stage.

## Round 1 - The Phone Screen

In the initial phone interview, you can expect the recruiter or hiring manager to assess your background and skills to ensure they align with the role. This is usually a 15 to 30 minute screening call where they will evaluate:

-  **Skills and Experience Match** - They will ask questions about your knowledge and proficiency with required technologies or processes for the job. Be ready to summarize your relevant background.

- **Communication Abilities** - Can you express your thoughts clearly and concisely? Recruiters will assess how well you communicate verbally.

- **Enthusiasm and Energy** - Bring some energy to the conversation to stand out. Demonstrate genuine excitement for the company and role.

To make a strong first impression, prepare stories relating your experiences to the job description. Highlight successes that prove you can excel in the position.

## Round 2 - The Technical Interview

Now it's time to showcase your technical abilities, usually through a remote coding test or onsite interview. You'll be asked in-depth questions about technologies, frameworks, coding and algorithms. Expect this round to last 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. Key areas interviewers evaluate:

- **Relevant Experience** - Draw clear connections between your background and project work compared to the role's tech requirements.

- **Engagement and Connection** - Technical skills are crucial, but building rapport can give you an edge over other qualified candidates. Show interest in your interviewers and the company's mission.

## Round 3 - The Behavioral Interview

The final interview round focuses on company culture and evaluating your soft skills. You'll likely meet with senior leadership in a more conversational setting. Typical areas covered include:

- **Leadership Style and Personality Traits** - Questions assess your temperament, thinking style, motivations and values. Be authentic and check your ego.

- **Collaboration Skills** - Give examples of when you resolved conflicts, influenced without authority and built alignment in past teams.

- **Growth Potential** - Share your development areas, career ambitions and eagerness to take on new challenges.

Preparing stories related to these subjects will help you make a connection in this critical culture fit round.

With practice and following these tips tailored to each interview stage, you can master the job interview process from screening call to final talks. Do your research, know your worth and strengths, and present them with enthusiasm, clarity and nuance appropriate for each round. You'll be securing that offer in no time!

# Boost Your Body Language to Ace the Interview

Your body language speaks volumes in a job interview. Even if you nail your responses, awkward posture or fidgeting could derail your chances. In this blog post, I'll share three simple yet effective tips from career coach Linda Raynier for projecting confident, interview-ready body language.

## 1. Relax and Feel at Ease

It's natural to feel nervous before an important interview. But anxious body language puts interviewers on edge too. Instead of viewing yourself as an anxious applicant, think of yourself as a consultant who knows they offer valuable skills. This mental shift can work wonders to naturally improve your physical confidence. Sit or stand tall, breathe deeply and speak assuredly about your capabilities. When you feel self-assured, interviewers will feel at ease with you.

## 2. Mimic the Interviewer

You want to establish mutual understanding and rapport in an interview. Subtly mirroring the interviewer's body language helps signal that you're in sync. If they lean in when speaking, lean in a bit too. Laugh when they tell a joke. Matching postures, expressions and energy levels sparks instinctive empathy and connection. Avoid outright copying every gesture, which looks odd. But gently reflecting body language back promotes engagement.

## 3. Stay Present and Engaged

It's tempting for minds to wander when nervous, wondering “What does the interviewer think of me?”. Drag your attention back to the conversation whenever it drifts. Planted feet help ground you too. Listening closely not only keeps you focused in the moment, but leads to better responses. Let their words guide what you should say next, rather than getting distracted by self-judgement.

With these three body language tips, you can walk into interviews exuding confidence through your posture, gestures, eye contact and more. The content of your answers still maters enormously. But refined body language ensures you're perceived as the calm, competent candidate you are. Pay attention to the signals your body sends, finesse areas of discomfort, and you'll have executive presence down pat.


# Deeply Research a Company Before Your Interview

You finally landed an interview for your dream job. Now it's time to wow the hiring manager with your company knowledge. Beyond skimming their “About” page, how do you thoroughly research an organization pre-interview? 

## Step 1: Scour the Company Website

Move beyond basic corporate overview content. Check department and role-specific pages on the site for functions related to the position you applied for. If interviewing for a finance job at a public company, study recent financial statements and releases. For marketing roles, review campaign results. Identify projects, challenges and goals for your potential future team.

## Step 2: Stay Updated with Google News

Learn the company's latest wins and struggles by Googling their name and custom date ranges. Did they recently acquire another organization or face a scandal? Being aware of current events shows you come informed and care. For example, if they were bought out, mention wanting to lend relevant experience during the transition.

## Step 3: Network on LinkedIn

Search for team members you'll meet with on LinkedIn and request an informational chat over coffee or the phone. People often oblige. Also connect with current and past employees to garner insider intel and tips. Understanding your interviewer's background facilitates rapport too.

## Step 4: Peruse Social Media Presences

Social media depicts company culture and priorities. Review their Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok accounts. Though not every organization utilizes social media, take note of causes they support, trends they discuss and workplace atmosphere. This grants insider perspective you can reference.

In today's age of personal branding and transparency, ample info is available to deeply research employers online. Show up to interviews ready to highlight projects tied to their goals and issues they face. Demonstrate genuine interest and care for their work. Thorough company research takes time but wins offers by wowing hiring managers with your strategic insight.


#  Dress to Impress for Your Interview

You nailed your interview prep, but don't neglect your interview attire. According to career coach Lindsey Raynier, your appearance makes an opening statement before you say a word. Follow these guidelines when deciding what to wear to convince hiring managers you're the most qualified professional – not the candidate with the wildest outfit.

## Do Your Research

Study the company's dress code before your interview. Check their website photos, employee LinkedIn profiles and social media to discern their style. Formal workplaces may expect suits while casual creative agencies could have t-shirts. If unsure, it's smart to err on the formal side. You want to look polished and serious about the role, even at laid-back companies. Go a notch above their day-to-day attire.

## Ensure Proper Fit

Avoid wardrobe malfunctions by wearing pieces that actually fit your frame. Forgo anything overly loose or tight. Ill-fitting clothing appears sloppy. If you recently gained or lost significant weight, get new interview basics tailored to your proportions. Feel confident you'll make a great impression rather than constantly adjusting yourself.

## Dress Like Your Best Self

The interview isn't the occasion to debut a radically new style. Opt for pieces that reflect your personality so you feel comfortable and confident. Seek input from friends with fashion sense similar to yours rather than forcing an incompatible look. The right clothes empower you to focus on your interview, not your outfit.

## Keep it Professional

While personal style matters, avoid anything overly flashy or trendy like heavy sequins or patterns. You want attention on your skills and credentials, not your neon green suit. Likewise, go light on bold jewelry, makeup and fragrances that could distract or irritate allergies. Think smart professional, not runway model. You can showcase more personality once you get the job!

The way you dress for the interview sends signals about your judgment and professionalism. By researching the role and company, understanding fit, choosing pieces you feel best in and keeping it workplace-appropriate, you'll exemplify you have what it takes, inside and out.

# Crickets After Your Interview? How to Politely Follow Up

You aced your internship interview and expected to hear back about next steps. But one week passes without an update. What should you do when faced with post-interview silence? Follow this formula to professionally check in.

## Ask About Next Steps Upfront

Before leaving your interview, inquire about their hiring timeline for the internship. This allows you to follow up at the appropriate time.

## Send a Friendly Note

If you hit the deadline with no update, email the recruiter: “I enjoyed our conversation and am still very interested in this internship opportunity. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me to assist with your selection process.”

## Check With Campus Career Services

Tap into your career services office to see if they have any inside information on start dates or changes with the internship program. This gives context beyond the silence.

## Try Once More, Then Let It Go

If you remain interested after a couple weeks of silence, send one more follow up note to politely reiterate your enthusiasm and qualifications. But avoid repeatedly pleading for an update.

While the anxious waiting game agonizes, avoid bombarding an employer with pleas for an update. With this structured game plan of timed follow-ups, you'll show persistent yet composed interest in an opportunity, whether they ultimately come through or not. Patience and graceful persistence pay off.

#  Tips to Negotiate Your Worth and Land Top Pay

You wowed your future employer and received an official offer letter! But what if the proposed salary seems underwhelming for your experience? Don't automatically accept whatever they first propose. Here's a strategic approach from career coach Linda Raynier to negotate respectfully and potentially increase that number.

## Wait for the Written Offer

The best time to negotiate pay for an internship is after receiving the official written offer. This shows the company is ready to finalize taking you on as an intern and will be most receptive to reasonable requests.

## Thank Your Recruiter

Sincerely thank the recruiter or hiring manager for extending an internship offer. Express enthusiasm about gaining hands-on experience at the company and contributing to impactful projects.

## Highlight Your Relevant Strengths

As a student, summarize specific coursework, leadership experience, or technical skills that make you uniquely qualified for this internship role. Mention any academic projects or previous internships supporting why you're worth investing in.

## Suggest a Fair Stipend Range

Politely ask, “With my background considered, would a stipend range of $X-Y per hour/week/summer be possible for this internship opportunity?”. Then don't fill the silence - give them a moment to consider your request.

If your figure exceeds their budget, inquire about alternate perks like mentorship, flex scheduling, or future full-time consideration to make up the difference in value.
